Compare Texas Electricity Rates and Plans
October historically ranks as Texas’s cheapest electricity shopping month—with rates running 10-25% lower than summer peaks. The pattern holds year after year: fall brings moderate weather, consumption drops 30-50%, and providers compete aggressively for annual contracts. If your plan is expiring soon or you’re stuck on a variable rate, you’re hitting the market at the right time.

Compare Power is Texas’ top-rated electricity marketplace, with over 75,000 five-star reviews. We’re independent, unaffiliated with any provider, and we compare over 250 real-time plans to show you what each one actually costs based on your usage—not the theoretical benchmarks providers advertise.

Here’s what you’ll find on this page: current rates for every major Texas city, which plan types work (and which are traps), how to compare based on your real annual usage instead of marketing gimmicks, and when to lock in rates to avoid next summer’s spikes.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average residential rate in Texas is 15.23 ¢/kWh, about 2.24 ¢/kWh (12.8%) lower than the national residential average of 17.47 ¢/kWh. For businesses, the Texas commercial average is 8.60 ¢/kWh, roughly 5.03 ¢/kWh (36.9 %) below the U.S. commercial average 13.63 ¢/kWh. Many fixed‑rate plans start at 10.40¢/kWh for households using 1,000 kWh or more.

Key Takeaways

October timing matters more than you think. Historical data shows October as the single cheapest month to shop, averaging 15.23 ¢/kWh and some fixed‑rate plans as low as 10.40¢/kWh. Securing a fixed rate today can help you avoid higher costs during peak summer demand.

Your usage tells the real story. Electric plans list prices at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 kWh—but those are just benchmarks. Texas households consume over 1,400 kWh per month during the summer, then drop to 800-900 kWh in the fall. To see what you’ll actually pay across the entire year, check your monthly usage and compare plans based on your real consumption pattern, not the advertised sweet spots.

ComparePower simplifies the process. We compare over 250 real-time electricity plans side by side and offer tools like Live Link™, which pulls your actual Smart Meter Texas data. You see what each plan would cost based on how you actually use electricity—no surprises, just transparent pricing.

Plan Rate Types Available in Texas
Fixed-Rate Plans — Lock in your price per kWh for six to thirty-six months. Good for predictable bills and protection from seasonal spikes. Fall is typically when these plans offer their most competitive pricing.

Time-of-Use Plans — Pay less during off-peak hours, such as nights and weekends. These made more sense during the summer when you could shift heavy AC loads to off-peak hours. In fall’s moderate weather, the savings often don’t justify the higher peak rates.

Prepaid Electricity — Pay as you go and track usage with alerts—some prepaid plans offer no deposit or credit check. It can serve as a short-term bridge if you’re waiting to secure a longer contract.

Flat-Rate Plans — Pay one flat fee regardless of your usage. Consistent monthly bills, but you typically pay a premium for this predictability.

Business Electricity Plans — Custom quotes for companies with significant power needs. Get a tailored rate that fits your operation.

How to Choose Your Best Energy Plan
The lowest rate isn’t always the best choice. Here’s why:

Advertised rates are benchmarks, not guarantees. Those eye-catching low advertised rates you see are calculated at exactly 500, 1,000, or 2,000 kWh. Use 1,001 kWh or 999 kWh, and your per-kWh cost can shift dramatically. Right now in fall, most homes use 800-900 kWh monthly—different from those advertised benchmarks.

Usage-based credits bite both ways. Some plans offer a bill credit if you stay within a specific range. Fall consumption typically drops to 800-900 kWh. If your plan requires 1,000 kWh to trigger a credit, you’ll miss it and pay the premium base rates for the entire season.

Seasonal swings affect your annual cost. You might use 800 kWh in November and 1,500 kWh next July. Select a plan that accommodates both extremes, not just today’s moderate usage.

Contract length controls when you shop next. This matters more than people realize. A 12-month plan signed in October puts your next renewal in October 2026—another good shopping window. But a 9-month plan expires in July when rates typically spike. Use contract length strategically.

Match your plan to your actual consumption pattern. Our Live Link tool pulls your actual usage history straight from the utility, so you can see how each plan would have priced your actual consumption across all twelve months.

With Live Link™, you get data-driven recommendations by pulling your real usage numbers directly from your utility. Skip the guesswork and compare plans based on your complete annual pattern.

Fall 2025 Energy Tips for Texans
Use Live Link™ to base your comparisons on real usage, not estimates. Your actual consumption pattern across twelve months shows you what you’ll really pay—not what providers advertise at convenient benchmarks.

Avoid late-summer renewals. Think about contract timing. October is historically a good shopping month. A 12-month plan signed now positions your next renewal in October 2026. A 6-month plan puts you back in the market in April (also typically good). But a 9-month plan expires in July when rates often spike.

Don’t get stuck on a variable plan. Simple fixed rates usually win. Bill credit plans, free nights, and seasonal discounts often end up costing more overall when you calculate the total annual cost. October’s competitive market means you can find solid, straightforward rates without gimmicks.

Texas Electricity Rates Chart

This chart tracks how residential and commercial rates in Texas fluctuate with the seasons. Notice the sharp jumps in summer when air conditioners across the state stress the grid. Business rates stay steadier, while residential customers see the most volatility.

Fall (September-November) typically shows moderate pricing as consumption drops and wholesale costs stabilize. Understanding these patterns helps you choose when to lock in a rate and when to keep shopping.

Fixed‑rate plans can shield you from summer spikes, while variable holdover rates may leave you exposed when demand peaks.

Texas Electricity Rates FAQs
Confused about Texas electricity rates? Here’s what you need to know.

Should I lock in a rate now or wait?
It depends on what the rates look like today versus historical patterns. October historically ranks as the cheapest month to shop, with rates typically 10-25% lower than in summer. If current rates are competitive (11-13¢/kWh range for 12-month fixed plans), locking in a rate protects you through next summer, when rates typically rise.

If you’re on a variable rate or your contract has expired, shopping now is better than waiting and hoping rates improve. Fall rates sometimes ease slightly through November, but the difference is usually marginal.

What are the average summer electricity bills in Texas?
Bills vary widely based on home size, efficiency, and habits. A typical home uses about 1,000 kWh in mild months but can hit 1,400-2,500 kWh in summer. Fall sees that drop to 800-900 kWh as AC usage plummets. At current competitive rates (11-13¢/kWh), you’re looking at roughly $90-120 monthly through November.

Should I switch plans before summer arrives?
If you’re on a variable rate or your contract expires before June, yes—lock in a fixed rate during fall or spring when pricing is typically more competitive. If your fixed rate expires in May, shop in April (historically another good month). Don’t let it roll to the variable right before summer.

Who has the cheapest electricity rates in Texas?
Gexa Energy, Frontier Utilities, and Rhythm Energy often show competitive rates. But “cheapest” depends on your specific usage pattern and location. A plan that’s cheap at 1,000 kWh might be expensive at 850 kWh or 1,200 kWh. Always compare based on your actual consumption.

What is a good electricity rate in Texas?
In fall 2025, competitive fixed-rate plans are available for 11-13¢/kWh over 12-month terms. What’s “good” depends on your usage level and where you live, but that range represents solid pricing in current market conditions.

How do I compare electric rates in Texas?
Start by looking at past bills to see how much you use each month—all twelve months, not just right now. Then compare plans based on your real consumption pattern and read the fine print on fees. The Electricity Facts Label (EFL) shows actual per-kWh pricing at different usage levels, reveals base charges and hidden fees, and explains conditions for any credits or discounts.

How do I find the best electricity rates in Texas?
Know your annual usage pattern, review both fixed and variable options, and watch for fees buried in the EFL. The best rate balances cost and flexibility for your specific needs. Use comparison tools that let you input your actual usage, not just the advertised benchmarks.

Who has the best electric rates in Texas?
It varies by provider, location, and your usage pattern. TXU, Reliant, and Green Mountain Energy often have competitive rates. Read reviews, compare plans based on your actual usage level, and review the EFL before committing.

Why are Texas electric bills so high?
If your bills are high right now in the fall, you’re likely on an expensive variable rate or a bill credit plan where you’re missing the threshold. Summer bills are high because of AC loads—unavoidable in Texas heat. High bills in moderate weather usually mean you’re on the wrong plan.

Why is Texas electricity so expensive?
Summer demand spikes, natural gas price fluctuations, and the deregulated market all play roles. Texas also has an isolated grid that can’t borrow power from neighboring states during shortages. Picking the right plan and shopping at the right time helps you manage costs.

Will Texas electricity rates go down in 2025?
Rates typically moderate from October through November as demand stays low. Looking ahead, wholesale markets suggest that power for 2026-2027 is currently trading at a lower price than for 2025, which could make longer-term contracts signed now more valuable. But market conditions change—nobody can guarantee future rates.

What is the current price of electricity in Texas?
Rates currently range from 9¢ to 23¢ per kWh depending on plan type, provider, and location. Most homes on fixed contracts pay 12-16¢/kWh. Variable rates fluctuate more widely and can spike higher during extreme weather conditions.
