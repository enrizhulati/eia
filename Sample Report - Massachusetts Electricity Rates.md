## State Rankings (2024 Annual Data)

| Category | MA Rank | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Price Rank** | #5 of 51 | 5th most expensive in US |
| **Total Sales** | #30 | Medium-sized market |
| **Net Generation** | #41 | Very low local generation |
| **Prime Source** | Natural Gas | ~65% of generation |

### The Generation Gap Problem
Massachusetts ranks:
- **#30 in electricity consumption** but
- **#41 in electricity generation**

This means Massachusetts is a **major net importer** of electricity, relying heavily on power from neighboring states and Canada.

## Historical Context & Outlook

### Why Are Rates So High?
1. **Pilgrim Nuclear Closure (2019)** - Lost 680 MW of low-cost baseload
2. **Natural Gas Constraints** - Limited pipeline capacity, winter price spikes
3. **Regional Geography** - Isolated grid, limited import capacity
4. **Environmental Costs** - Aggressive RPS and carbon reduction mandates

### Future Outlook
| Factor | Direction | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Offshore Wind | ↗️ Coming online | Potential rate relief 2027+ |
| Natural Gas Prices | → Stable | Rates stable short-term |
| Transmission Upgrades | ↗️ Investments | Better imports, but adds costs |
| Electrification | ↗️ Growing | Higher demand, uncertain rate impact |
