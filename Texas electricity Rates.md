H2: Winter Electricity Shopping in Texas - ComparePower Voice

Let's cut to the chase: **winter is not the best time to shop for electricity in Texas.** Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) are when rates hit their sweet spot. But here's the thing - if your contract is expiring right now in December, or you're staring down a January renewal, you don't get to pick your timing.

So let's talk about what's actually happening in the Texas electricity market this winter, what you can expect to pay, and how to avoid getting screwed.

## The Good News: December 2025 Is Actually Pretty Stable

Here's something you probably haven't heard much: **the Texas grid is looking solid right now.** ERCOT (the folks who manage our power grid) is predicting only a 1.81% chance of grid emergencies in December. That's about as close to "smooth sailing" as Texas electricity gets.

Why? The grid has more backup power than ever before:

- Battery storage systems that can kick in during tight spots
- Solar farms producing steady daytime power
- Natural gas plants ready to ramp up when needed
- New regulations forcing data centers and big industrial users to have backup generators

Translation: If you're shopping right now in December, you're actually in a decent window. Not great (that would be April or October), but decent.

## The Bad News: January and February Are Coming

Here's what nobody's telling you: **January is historically one of the most expensive months to shop for electricity** - right up there with July and August.

Historical data shows January averaging 18.19¢/kWh. That's not a typo. January can be just as expensive as peak summer.

Winter rates in Texas typically run 11-16¢/kWh, which sounds better than summer's 15-20¢/kWh range. But here's the catch: winter is unpredictable. We can go from 70-degree sunshine to 20-degree ice storms in the same week. And when those cold snaps hit? Your electricity bill - and market rates - can spike hard.

Remember Winter Storm Uri in 2021? That wasn't just a grid failure. It was a pricing disaster. People on variable-rate plans got bills for thousands of dollars. The grid wasn't ready, natural gas plants froze, and wholesale prices went through the roof.

Things are better now, but the risk hasn't disappeared.

## What Your Actual Usage Looks Like in Winter

Let's talk numbers. Texas winters are nothing like northern states. We're not running our heaters 24/7 for six months straight.

Typical Texas winter usage: 800-1,000 kWh per month

Compare that to:

- Summer: 1,200-1,500 kWh (air conditioning dominates)
- Spring/Fall: 700-900 kWh (the sweet spot)

Your winter bill is moderate. Lower than summer for sure, but not quite as low as those beautiful spring and fall months when you can just open the windows.

Here's why this matters: **if you're shopping at the default 1,000 kWh price point, you might actually be close to your real winter usage.** That's different from fall (when you're using less) or summer (when you're using way more). At least you're comparing apples to apples.

But - and this is important - don't shop based on winter usage if you're signing a 12-month contract. You need to know what that plan costs in July when you're using 1,400 kWh, not just what it costs in February at 900 kWh.

## The Current Market: What Rates Look Like Right Now

As of December 2025, here's what you're looking at:

**Current average rate in Texas: 15-18¢/kWh** (including delivery charges)

**Lowest rates available: Around 9.7-11¢/kWh** for simple fixed-rate plans

**Target range for decent plans: 14-17¢/kWh**

That's higher than fall's 11-13¢/kWh sweet spot, but not as brutal as January's historical 18+ cent averages.

Wholesale prices are actually down from last year (around $27-34/MWh versus $35/MWh in 2024). Natural gas prices are up 24% to about $3.37/MMBtu, which normally would push retail rates higher. But massive solar expansion is keeping things in check.

The bottom line: Rates aren't amazing right now, but they're stable. And stability beats volatility when you're trying to budget your monthly bills.

## Why Winter Rates Are Higher Than You'd Expect

Okay, so if winter usage is moderate and wholesale prices are stable, why aren't rates cheaper?

Three reasons:

**1. Heating demand is real**

Texas homes aren't built for cold weather. We've got minimal insulation compared to northern states. When it drops to 30 degrees, our electric heating systems work overtime trying to compensate for drafty windows and poorly insulated attics.

Morning and evening are the worst. Everyone cranks up the heat when they wake up and when they get home from work. That creates demand spikes that stress the grid - especially during those tight 7-8 AM windows when solar hasn't kicked in yet.

**2. Winter Storm Risk Premium**

Providers remember Uri. They know that one bad ice storm can shut down the grid and send wholesale prices into the stratosphere. So they build risk premiums into winter contracts to protect themselves.

You're essentially paying insurance against the chance of another winter disaster.

**3. Natural Gas Price Volatility**

Natural gas generates about 45% of Texas electricity. In winter, gas prices can spike when:

- Cold weather increases demand for heating nationwide
- Export demand from LNG terminals stays high
- Pipeline infrastructure freezes during extreme cold

When wholesale gas prices jump, retail electricity rates follow.

## What You Should Actually Do If You're Shopping Right Now

**If your contract expires in December:**

You're in decent shape. Shop now and lock in a 12-month or 24-month fixed-rate plan. You'll skip the expensive January-February window and coast through to next winter at stable rates.

Target: 14-17¢/kWh for solid plans. If you find anything under 14¢, that's a win.

**If your contract expires in January or February:**

You have two options:

1. **Lock in now and eat the early termination fee** (if it makes financial sense - see the math below)
2. **Take a short bridge plan to spring** - A 3-4 month variable or short-term fixed plan gets you to March/April when rates typically drop

Option 2 is risky if we get hit with a winter storm. Option 1 costs money upfront but protects you.

**If your contract doesn't expire until spring or summer:**

Do nothing. You're already in the best position possible. Just set a reminder to shop when your contract actually ends.

## The Early Termination Fee Math (Again)

Let's say you're stuck in a contract that doesn't expire until February. But rates right now in December are 15¢/kWh and you're currently paying 18¢/kWh.

Your ETF is $200. Should you break your contract?

Here's the math:

- Savings: 3¢/kWh difference
- Monthly usage: 900 kWh (typical winter)
- Monthly savings: $27
- Payback period: 7.4 months

Plus, you've just shifted your renewal date from February (expensive) to December (decent). That's worth something on its own.

In this scenario? Breaking the contract probably makes sense.

But if the rate difference is only 1-2¢/kWh? Probably not worth it. You won't recover the ETF cost fast enough.

## The Plans to Avoid (They're Extra Bad in Winter)

**Bill Credit Plans**

These are the "get $100 off when you use exactly 1,000 kWh" plans. They're always questionable, but they're especially problematic in winter.

Why? Because your usage bounces around. A mild week in December? You might use 700 kWh. A cold snap in January? You might hit 1,200 kWh. Either way, you miss the credit threshold and pay penalty rates.

Stick with simple fixed-rate plans that don't punish you for weather variation.

**Free Nights and Weekends Plans**

These sound great until you do the math. Yes, electricity is "free" from 8 PM to 6 AM or whatever the window is. But you're paying 17-20¢/kWh during the day.

In summer, you might be able to shift enough usage to off-peak hours to make it work. In winter? Your heating runs when it's cold, not when electricity is cheap. You don't get to tell your heater "sorry, it's 3 PM, we only run during free hours."

These plans typically cost 30% more than straightforward fixed-rate plans for typical households.

**3-Month Plans Signed in Winter**

If you sign a 3-month plan in December, it expires in March. That's actually okay - March is a decent shopping month.

But if you sign a 3-month plan in January? It expires in April (good). In February? May (also good).

The danger is signing a 6-month plan right now. December + 6 months = June. That's getting into expensive summer territory. You'd have been better off with a 12-month plan to protect yourself.

## Long-Term Contracts Are Your Friend Right Now

Here's something most Texans don't know: **24-month and 36-month contracts are often the best value, especially when signed during stable periods like right now.**

Why?

Wholesale forward contracts are showing something weird: Power for 2025 is trading at a premium, but power for 2026-2027 is cheaper. That's unusual. It typically means long-term contracts signed now will look like genius moves in hindsight.

Plus, locking in for 24 months right now means:

- You skip expensive summer 2025 rates
- You skip expensive winter 2025-2026 rates
- You skip expensive summer 2026 rates
- You don't have to think about electricity shopping for two years

Yes, you're committing. But committing to stable rates beats gambling on market conditions.

Typical savings: 24-month contracts run 8-10% lower rates than 12-month contracts. That's real money over time.

## What Makes December 2025 Special

Let's talk about why right now is better than usual for winter shopping:

**1. Grid Improvements Post-Uri**

Texas spent billions upgrading infrastructure after the 2021 disaster. Generators are weatherized. We have better backup power. Communication systems are improved. The grid is legitimately more reliable than it was four years ago.

**2. Battery Storage Explosion**

Texas added thousands of megawatts of battery storage in the past two years. These systems can discharge power during tight spots - like those 7-8 AM morning peaks when everyone's heater kicks on but solar hasn't started producing yet.

**3. Solar Growth Continues**

We added 10 GW of solar in 2024. Another 26 GW is coming in 2025. That's keeping wholesale prices lower during daylight hours, which helps moderate retail rates.

**4. Natural Gas Prices Are Up But Not Crazy**

At $3.37/MMBtu, natural gas is higher than 2024's lows but nowhere near the $7-9/MMBtu spikes we saw after the Ukraine invasion. That's keeping a lid on electricity costs.

**5. Mild Weather Forecast (For Now)**

ERCOT isn't predicting any major cold snaps or grid emergencies for December. Obviously weather can change, but starting from a position of stability is good.

All of this adds up to: **If you have to shop in winter, December 2025 is probably your best bet.**

## What Could Still Go Wrong

Let's be honest - this is Texas electricity. Things can always go sideways.

**Winter Storm Risk**

One major ice storm can shut down natural gas plants, freeze wind turbines, and spike demand all at once. If you're on a variable-rate plan during that window, your bill could be catastrophic.

This is why fixed-rate plans matter. They protect you from wholesale market chaos.

**Natural Gas Price Spikes**

If LNG exports surge or cold weather hits nationwide, natural gas prices could jump quickly. That would ripple into retail electricity rates within weeks.

**Grid Emergency**

ERCOT says there's less than 2% chance of emergency. That's great odds. But it's not zero. If demand spikes unexpectedly and supply can't keep up, we could see conservation requests or rotating outages.

Your fixed-rate contract protects your bill but not your lights.

**Demand Growth**

Texas is adding population fast. We're adding energy-hungry industries even faster (AI data centers, crypto mining, manufacturing). ERCOT predicts 50% demand growth by 2029. That's a lot of pressure on the grid.

Longer-term contracts lock you in before that demand growth hits pricing.

## The Simple Strategy That Works

Here's what you actually need to do:

**1. Check your contract expiration date right now**

Pull up your current plan details. When does it end? If it's December or January, you need to act this week.

**2. Shop using your actual usage data**

Don't just look at the default 1,000 kWh price point. Use Live Link™ to pull your Smart Meter Texas data and see what plans REALLY cost based on your actual usage patterns across all 12 months.

A plan that looks amazing at 1,000 kWh might be terrible at 1,400 kWh (your summer usage) or 800 kWh (your spring usage).

**3. Target simple fixed-rate plans**

No bill credits. No free nights. No seasonal variations. Just a straightforward per-kWh rate that doesn't change.

In December 2025, target 14-17¢/kWh. Anything under 14¢ is a win.

**4. Consider 24-month contracts**

Yes, it's longer. But the rates are better, and you're protecting yourself from two summer peaks and two winter storms. That's worth the commitment.

**5. Read the Electricity Facts Label**

Every. Single. Time.

The EFL is where the truth lives. The advertised rate is marketing. The EFL shows you:

- What you actually pay at different usage levels
- Early termination fees
- Base charges and hidden fees
- Contract length and renewal terms

Spend five minutes reading it before you sign. It'll save you hundreds in avoided mistakes.

## What If You Absolutely Can't Get Good Rates Right Now?

Sometimes the market just sucks. If you're shopping in late January or early February and rates are 18-20¢/kWh, what do you do?

**Option 1: Short bridge plan to spring**

Take a 2-3 month variable or short-term fixed plan. Yes, you're gambling on weather. But you're only exposed for 60-90 days, then you can shop again in March-April when rates are historically better.

Risk: Winter storm could spike your bill for 1-2 months.

Reward: You get to shop during a much cheaper season.

**Option 2: Bite the bullet on a 12-month plan**

Lock in whatever rate you can get - even if it's high - knowing you'll be protected through the full year. At least you won't be on a variable rate when the next heat wave hits.

Yes, you're paying more than you would in spring. But you're buying certainty.

**Option 3: Move to a more efficient home** (kidding)

(But seriously, if you're a renter and electricity is making you broke, this is worth considering for your next lease)

## The Mistakes That Cost Texans Money Every Winter

Let's count the ways people overpay:

**Mistake #1: Waiting Until January to Shop**

January is historically one of the most expensive months. If your contract expires in January, shop NOW in December and use the 14-day pre-expiration switching rule to schedule your new plan.

Waiting until January starts means shopping during the worst possible pricing window.

**Mistake #2: Being Impressed by "Winter Savers" Plans**

Some providers offer seasonal plans that give you discounts in winter but jack up rates in summer. Sounds good until you realize you're paying 20¢/kWh in July to get 13¢/kWh in January.

You can't spend your way to savings. Do the math across all 12 months.

**Mistake #3: Not Reading the EFL**

We know, it's boring. It's full of fine print. But it's the only place where the real costs are disclosed.

That "amazing rate" advertised on PowerToChoose? It might only apply if you use exactly 1,000 kWh. Use 999 kWh or 1,001 kWh and the rate jumps 4 cents.

The EFL tells you this. The ad doesn't.

**Mistake #4: Staying on Your Provider's Renewal Rate**

When your contract expires, most providers automatically roll you onto a month-to-month renewal rate. These rates are typically 20-30% higher than new customer rates.

Why? Because they know most people won't bother shopping. Inertia is profitable.

Break the cycle. Shop every time your contract ends.

**Mistake #5: Picking Plans Based on Summer Usage**

You can't just look at what a plan costs in summer and assume it's good year-round. Bill credit plans that work great at 1,500 kWh (summer) can be disasters at 800 kWh (winter).

You need to evaluate costs across your full usage range.

## Why Live Link™ Actually Matters

Look, we're not going to beat you over the head with a sales pitch. But here's why this matters:

[**PowerToChoose.org](http://PowerToChoose.org) only shows rates at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 kWh.** That's it. Three arbitrary data points that might have nothing to do with your actual usage.

Your winter usage might be 850 kWh. Your summer usage might be 1,350 kWh. How much does that plan REALLY cost you? PowerToChoose can't tell you.

Live Link™ pulls your actual Smart Meter Texas data - all 12 months of it - and calculates what each plan would cost based on YOUR real usage patterns. No guessing. No estimating. Just math.

It takes about three minutes. And it tells you the truth about what you'll actually pay.

That's the difference between shopping based on marketing and shopping based on your reality.

## The Bottom Line: What This All Means for You

Here's what you need to remember:

**December 2025 is actually a decent time to shop** for winter standards. The grid is stable, rates are moderate, and you can lock in protection through expensive January-February and into next summer.

**Target 14-17¢/kWh for solid fixed-rate plans.** Anything under 14¢ is a win. Anything over 18¢ means you should probably wait or take a bridge plan to spring.

**Avoid gimmicky plans** - bill credits, free nights/weekends, seasonal variations. They sound good in commercials but cost more in reality. Simple fixed rates beat complex plans about 95% of the time.

**24-month contracts are worth considering** right now. You're locking in stable rates before projected demand growth hits pricing. Plus you skip two expensive summer peaks.

**If you're stuck shopping in January or February,** consider short bridge plans to get you to spring (March-April) when rates historically drop. Just understand the weather risk.

**Use your actual usage data to compare plans.** The default 1,000 kWh price point might have nothing to do with what you'll actually pay. Three minutes with Live Link™ tells you the real cost.

Most importantly: **Don't panic, but don't wait.** If your contract expires soon, shop this week. If it doesn't expire until spring or summer, relax and set a reminder.

Winter electricity shopping in Texas isn't ideal. But it doesn't have to be a disaster either. Arm yourself with real data, avoid the marketing traps, and lock in a simple fixed-rate plan that protects you through all four seasons.

Then get back to your day, confident you aren't overpaying.
